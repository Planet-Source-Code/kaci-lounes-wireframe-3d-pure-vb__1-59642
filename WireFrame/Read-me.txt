3D WireFrame, by KACI Lounes March/2005
---------------------------------------

This is a 3d wireframe engine fully in vb!
no references, no DLLs, no OCXs, just pure vb code.

As you saw, there are four primatives (Grid, Sphere, Torus and Teapot),
(see screen shot), The teapot is rotated for each
frame rendered, into Z axis (Roll).

You have two mode for viewing the scene:

1- Pitch/Yaw mode: You can control the position and the orientation
2- LookAt mode: You can control only the position

Controls:
--------

Up/Down: walk to front/back
Right/Left/Home/End: respectively: Pitch+/Pitch-/Yaw+/Yaw-
NumPad 1, 2, 3: (Only LookAt mode) look at: Sphere/Teapot/Torus

 Yes, i see that this project is slow, but i prefer the
quality that the speed, I would like this well
that 'Mazes of mouse' !! (Sorry for some peoples).

Future additions:
-----------------

- Flat/Gouraud Shading
- Lighting effects with multiple lights and light types (Spot, Point)
- Support for texture mapping & wrapping & filtering
- Z-Buffer, classical painter's algorithm
- Full support for collisions detection
- AntiAliasing

  and mooore.......

The code is written of a way that it is legible and understanding,
and the 3D programming is clearly classified.
